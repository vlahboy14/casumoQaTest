###### This demo test automation project is created in order to verify Casumo GET end-point
Tools I decided to use are: 1)Java as programming language, 2)Rest Assured as Java library, 3)Data Driven Approach

To consistently safeguard and monitor the reliability of the service I would follow next measures:
1. Conduct regular maintenance and updates: Regular maintenance of the service infrastructure, including hardware and software updates, can help prevent downtime, errors, and vulnerabilities.
2. Use monitoring tools: Implement monitoring tools that can track the performance, uptime, and user experience of the service. This can help detect issues before they become critical and ensure the service is consistently meeting the expected standards.
3. Conduct regular testing: Conduct regular testing, such as load testing, stress testing, and security testing, to identify potential weaknesses in the service and improve its overall reliability.
